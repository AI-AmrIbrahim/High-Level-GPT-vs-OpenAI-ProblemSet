Let's tackle each one step by step.\n\n### 1. P.d.f. of $X_{min}$\n\n**Approach:**\n\nThe minimum of a sample, $X_{min} = \\min(X_1, \\ldots, X_9)$, is a random variable whose distribution can be derived from the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.). \n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **C.d.f. of $X_{min}$:**\n\n   The c.d.f. of $X_{min}$, $F_{X_{min}}(x)$, is the probability that all sample values are greater than $x$:\n   \\[\n   F_{X_{min}}(x) = P(X_{min} \\leq x) = 1 - P(X_1 > x, X_2 > x, \\ldots, X_9 > x).\n   \\]\n\n   Since $X_i \\sim U[0, 1]$, $P(X_i > x) = 1 - x$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   P(X_1 > x, X_2 > x, \\ldots, X_9 > x) = (1-x)^9.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, the c.d.f. is:\n   \\[\n   F_{X_{min}}(x) = 1 - (1-x)^9.\n   \\]\n\n2. **P.d.f. of $X_{min}$:**\n\n   Differentiate the c.d.f. to get the p.d.f.:\n   \\[\n   f_{X_{min}}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} F_{X_{min}}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [1 - (1-x)^9] = 9(1-x)^8.\n   \\]\n\n   The p.d.f. is:\n   \\[\n   f_{X_{min}}(x) = 9(1-x)^8, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1.\n   \\]\n\n### 2.

P.d.f. of the Sample Median $\\tilde{X}$\n\n**Approach:**\n\nThe sample median $\\tilde{X}$ of 9 i.i.d. uniform random variables is the 5th order statistic. The p.d.f. of an order statistic can be derived using the binomial coefficient.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **P.d.f. of the 5th Order Statistic:**\n\n   The p.d.f. of the $k$-th order statistic $X_{(k)}$ from a sample of size $n$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   f_{X_{(k)}}(x) = \\frac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} [F(x)]^{k-1} [1-F(x)]^{n-k} f(x),\n   \\]\n   where $F(x)$ is the c.d.f. of the uniform distribution, and $f(x)$ is its p.d.f.\n\n   For the 5th order statistic ($k=5$, $n=9$):\n   \\[\n   f_{\\tilde{X}}(x) = \\frac{9!}{4!4!} x^4 (1-x)^4 \\cdot 1.\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the factorials:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9!}{4!4!} = \\frac{362880}{24 \\times 24} = 126.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the p.d.f. is:\n   \\[\n   f_{\\tilde{X}}(x) = 126 x^4 (1-x)^4, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1.\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answers\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{X_{min}}(x) &= 9(1-x)^8, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1, \\\\\nf_{X_{max}}(x) &= 9x^8, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1, \\\\\nf_{\\tilde{X}}(x) &= 126 x^4 (1-x)^4, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1.\n\\end{align*}\n}\n\\]"

Thus,\n  \\[\n  P(Z > 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228\n  \\]\n\n#### Case (iii): $\\bar{x} = 0.1$, $n = 900$\n\n- **Calculate the Test Statistic**:\n  \\[\n  Z = \\frac{0.1 - 0}{1 / \\sqrt{900}} = 0.1 \\times 30 = 3\n  \\]\n\n- **P-value**:\n  \\[\n  P(Z > 3) = 1 - \\Phi(3)\n  \\]\n  Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, $\\Phi(3) \\approx 0.9987$. Thus,\n  \\[\n  P(Z > 3) = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Case (i)**: The P-value is 0.1587, which is not significant at the typical $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. We do not reject $H_0$.\n- **Case (ii)**: The P-value is 0.0228, which is significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. We reject $H_0$.\n- **Case (iii)**: The P-value is 0.0013, which is highly significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. We reject $H_0$.\n\nAs the sample size increases, the test becomes more sensitive to detecting a true positive mean, leading to smaller P-values and stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{P-values: (i) 0.1587, (ii) 0.0228, (iii) 0.0013}}\n\\]"

If the sample is not random, the results of the test may not be generalizable to the entire population of Illinois farmers.\n- **Normality Assumption:** The normality assumption is less critical in this context because of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough (typically $n \\geq 30$), regardless of the population distribution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assumption that the 50 farmers form a random sample from the population of all Illinois farmers is more important to the validity of the conclusion drawn from this test. This is because the CLT mitigates concerns about normality with a sufficiently large sample size, but a non-random sample could lead to biased results.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Random sample assumption is more important.}}\n\\]"

Given the sample size and known standard deviation, we will use the standard normal distribution to determine the critical values for a 0.05-level test.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sample mean $\\bar{x}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $\\sigma = 0.1$ oz and $n = 9$.\n- The standard error of the mean is $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{0.1}{\\sqrt{9}} = 0.0333$ oz.\n- For a two-sided test at the 0.05 significance level, the critical z-values are $\\pm z_{0.025}$, where $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\n- The decision rule is: Reject $H_0$ if $\\bar{x}$ is outside the interval $[16 - 1.96 \\times 0.0333, 16 + 1.96 \\times 0.0333]$.\n\nCalculating the interval:\n\\[\n16 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.0333 = 16 \\pm 0.0653\n\\]\nThus, the decision rule is: Reject $H_0$ if $\\bar{x} < 15.9347$ or $\\bar{x} > 16.0653$.\n\n### (c) Probability of Correctly Detecting a True Mean of 16.1 oz\n\n**Approach:**\nWe need to calculate the power of the test, which is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when the true mean is 16.1 oz.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Under the alternative hypothesis, $\\mu = 16.1$ oz.\n- The sample mean $\\bar{x}$ follows a normal distribution with mean 16.1 and standard deviation 0.0333.\n- We need to find $P(\\bar{x} < 15.9347 \\text{ or } \\bar{x} > 16.0653)$ when $\\mu = 16.1$.\n\nCalculate the z-scores:\n- For $\\bar{x} = 15.9347$: \n  \\[\n  z = \\frac{15.9347 - 16.1}{0.0333} \\approx -4.96\n  \\]\n- For $\\bar{x} = 16.0653$: \n  \\[\n  z = \\frac{16.0653 - 16.1}{0.0333} \\approx -1.04\n  \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution:\n- $P(Z < -4.96) \\approx 0$ (very small)\n- $P(Z > -1.04) = 1 - P(Z < -1.04) \\approx 1 - 0.1492 = 0.8508$\n\nThus, the probability of correctly detecting the deviation (power) is approximately 0.8508.\n\n### (d) Sample Size for 90% Power\n\n**Approach:**\nTo achieve 90% power, we need to determine the sample size $n$ such that the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $\\mu = 16.1$ is 0.9.\n\n**Solution:**\n- We want $P(\\bar{x} < 15.9347 \\text{ or } \\bar{x} > 16.0653) = 0.9$ when $\\mu = 16.1$.\n- The critical z-value for 90% power is $z_{0.1} \\approx 1.28$ (since $1 - 0.9 = 0.1$).\n\nSet up the equation for the upper bound:\n\\[\n\\frac{16.0653 - 16.1}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = -1.28\n\\]\nSolving for $n$:\n\\[\n-1.28 = \\frac{-0.0347}{0.1/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.28 \\times 0.1/\\sqrt{n} = 0.0347\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{1.28 \\times 0.1}{0.0347} \\approx 3.69\n\\]\n\\[\nn \\approx 3.69^2 \\approx 13.64\n\\]\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we round up to $n = 14$.\n\nThus, to achieve 90% power, a sample size of 14 cans is needed.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n = 14}\n\\]"

Since $0.83 < 2.576$, we fail to reject $H_0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the speedometers have a bias.\n\n### (d) Power Calculation for 50 Speedometers\n\n**Approach:**\nCalculate the power of the test if 50 speedometers are tested and the actual bias is 0.5 mph, assuming $\\sigma = 0.8$.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Calculate the non-centrality parameter:**\n   \\[\n   \\delta = \\frac{0.5}{0.8/\\sqrt{50}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.113} \\approx 4.42\n   \\]\n\n2. **Power calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Power} = \\Phi\\left( z_{\\alpha/2} - \\delta \\right) + \\Phi\\left( -z_{\\alpha/2} - \\delta \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Power} = \\Phi\\left( 2.576 - 4.42 \\right) + \\Phi\\left( -2.576 - 4.42 \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Power} = \\Phi\\left( -1.844 \\right) + \\Phi\\left( -6.996 \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Power} \\approx 0.0327 + 0 \\approx 0.0327\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe power of the test with 50 speedometers and an actual bias of 0.5 mph is approximately 0.0327, indicating a low probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis if the true bias is 0.5 mph.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a) \\text{Hypotheses: } H_0: \\mu = 55, \\, H_a: \\mu \\neq 55}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{(b) \\text{Sample size: } n = 11}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{(c) \\text{Conclusion: Fail to reject } H_0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{(d) \\text{Power: } 0.0327}\n\\]"

            "solution": "To solve this problem, we will go through each part step-by-step, providing detailed explanations and calculations.\n\n### (a) Explanation of Matched Pairs\n\n**Approach:**\nMatched pairs occur when each observation in one sample is uniquely paired with an observation in another sample. This is often the case when measurements are taken from the same subject under different conditions.\n\n**Explanation:**\nIn this problem, the samples are matched pairs because each person has two measurements: one from the eye affected by glaucoma and one from the unaffected eye. The measurements are paired because they come from the same individual, allowing us to control for individual variability.\n\n### (b) Scatter Plot and Analysis\n\n**Approach:**\nCreate a scatter plot with the corneal thickness of the eye affected by glaucoma on the y-axis and the unaffected eye on the x-axis. Analyze the position of the points relative to the 45\u00b0 line (y = x).\n\n**Scatter Plot Analysis:**\n- Plot the points: (484, 488), (478, 478), (492, 480), (444, 426), (436, 440), (398, 410), (464, 458), (476, 460).\n- The 45\u00b0 line represents equal thickness in both eyes. Points above this line indicate thicker corneas in the unaffected eye, while points below indicate thicker corneas in the affected eye.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMost points lie below the 45\u00b0 line, suggesting that eyes affected by glaucoma tend to have thinner corneas than unaffected eyes.\n\n### (c) Hypothesis Test\n\n**Approach:**\nPerform a paired t-test to compare the means of the two samples.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n- \\( H_0: \\mu_d = 0 \\) (no difference in means)\n- \\( H_a: \\mu_d \\neq 0 \\) (difference in means)\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Calculate the differences: \\( d_i = X_i - Y_i \\)\n   - Differences: 4, 0, -12, -18, 4, 12, -6, -16\n2. Mean of differences: \\( \\bar{d} = \\frac{4 + 0 - 12 - 18 + 4 + 12 - 6 - 16}{8} = -4.0 \\)\n3. Standard deviation of differences: \n   \\[\n   s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d_i - \\bar{d})^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(4+4)^2 + (0+4)^2 + (-12+4)^2 + (-18+4)^2 + (4+4)^2 + (12+4)^2 + (-6+4)^2 + (-16+4)^2}{7}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{\\frac{64 + 16 + 256 + 484 + 64 + 256 + 36 + 256}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1432}{7}} \\approx 14.3\n   \\]\n4. Test statistic: \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s_d/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{-4.0}{14.3/\\sqrt{8}} \\approx -0.79\n   \\]\n5. Degrees of freedom: \\( n-1 = 7 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUsing a t-table, the critical t-value for \\( \\alpha = 0.10 \\) and 7 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.895. Since \\(|t| = 0.79 < 1.895\\), we fail to reject \\( H_0 \\). There is no significant difference in corneal thickness at the 0.10 level.\n\n### (d) 90% Confidence Interval for Mean Difference\n\n**Approach:**\nUse the formula for the confidence interval of the mean difference in paired samples.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Margin of error: \\( t_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}} \\)\n- \\( t_{\\alpha/2} \\approx 1.895 \\) for 90% confidence and 7 df.\n- Margin of error: \\( 1.895 \\times \\frac{14.3}{\\sqrt{8}} \\approx 9.57 \\)\n\n**Confidence Interval:**\n\\[\n\\bar{d} \\pm \\text{Margin of Error} = -4.0 \\pm 9.57 = (-13.57, 5.57)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe 90% confidence interval for the mean difference is \\((-13.57, 5.57)\\). This interval includes 0, indicating no significant difference.\n\n### (e) Sign Test\n\n**Approach:**\nPerform a sign test to determine if there is a difference in corneal thickness.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Count the number of positive and negative differences.\n- Positive differences: 3 (4, 0, 4)\n- Negative differences: 5 (-12, -18, -6, -16)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWith a two-tailed sign test at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), the critical value for 8 pairs is 2. Since the number of positive differences (3) is greater than 2, we fail to reject \\( H_0 \\). There is no significant difference.\n\n### (f) Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test\n\n**Approach:**\nPerform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Rank the absolute differences: 0, 4, 4, 6, 12, 12, 16, 18\n2. Assign ranks: 1, 2.5, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 5.5, 7, 8\n3. Sum of positive ranks: 1 + 2.5 + 5.5 = 9\n4. Sum of negative ranks: 2.5 + 4 + 5.5 + 7 + 8 = 27\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe smaller sum of ranks is 9. For \\( n = 8 \\), the critical value at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is 5. Since 9 > 5, we fail to reject \\( H_0 \\). There is no significant difference in corneal thickness.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- (a) Samples are matched pairs because each pair of measurements comes from the same individual.\n- (b) Scatter plot shows points below the 45\u00b0 line, indicating thinner corneas in affected eyes.\n- (c) Fail to reject \\( H_0 \\); no significant difference at \\(\\alpha = 0.10\\).\n- (d) 90% CI: \\((-13.57, 5.57)\\); includes 0, indicating no significant difference.\n- (e) Sign test: Fail to reject \\( H_0 \\); no significant difference.\n- (f) Wilcoxon test: Fail to reject \\( H_0 \\); no significant difference."

We will perform this calculation under two different assumptions: first, assuming equal variances, and second, without assuming equal variances. Let's go through each part step-by-step.\n\n### Part (a): Assuming Equal Variances\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Calculate the pooled variance.\n2. Use the pooled variance to find the standard error of the difference in means.\n3. Determine the critical value from the t-distribution.\n4. Construct the confidence interval.\n5. Check for statistical significance.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Pooled Variance:**\n\n   The pooled variance $s_p^2$ is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the given values:\n\n   \\[\n   s_p^2 = \\frac{(21 - 1) \\cdot 4.5 + (21 - 1) \\cdot 2.0}{21 + 21 - 2} = \\frac{90 + 40}{40} = \\frac{130}{40} = 3.25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Standard Error of the Difference:**\n\n   The standard error (SE) of the difference in means is:\n\n   \\[\n   SE = \\sqrt{s_p^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{3.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{21}\\right)} = \\sqrt{3.25 \\cdot \\frac{2}{21}} = \\sqrt{0.3095} \\approx 0.556\n   \\]\n\n3. **Critical Value:**\n\n   For a 95% confidence interval and degrees of freedom $df = n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 40$, the critical value $t^*$ from the t-distribution is approximately 2.021 (using a t-table or calculator).\n\n4. **Confidence Interval:**\n\n   The confidence interval for $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ is:\n\n   \\[\n   (\\bar{x} - \\bar{y}) \\pm t^* \\cdot SE = (8.0 - 6.5) \\pm 2.021 \\cdot 0.556\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\pm 1.123 \\Rightarrow (0.377, 2.623)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Statistical Significance:**\n\n   Since the confidence interval does not include 0, there is a statistically significant difference at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n### Part (b): Without Assuming Equal Variances\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Use the separate variances to calculate the standard error.\n2. Determine the degrees of freedom using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation.\n3. Find the critical value from the t-distribution.\n4. Construct the confidence interval.\n5. Check for statistical significance.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Standard Error of the Difference:**\n\n   The standard error (SE) is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.5}{21} + \\frac{2.0}{21}} = \\sqrt{0.2143 + 0.0952} = \\sqrt{0.3095} \\approx 0.556\n   \\]\n\n2. **Degrees of Freedom:**\n\n   Using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation:\n\n   \\[\n   df = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\\right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{n_2 - 1}}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   df = \\frac{(0.2143 + 0.0952)^2}{\\frac{(0.2143)^2}{20} + \\frac{(0.0952)^2}{20}} \\approx \\frac{0.3095^2}{0.0023 + 0.0005} \\approx \\frac{0.0958}{0.0028} \\approx 34.21\n   \\]\n\n   We round down to 34 degrees of freedom.\n\n3. **Critical Value:**\n\n   For 34 degrees of freedom, the critical value $t^*$ is approximately 2.032.\n\n4. **Confidence Interval:**\n\n   \\[\n   (\\bar{x} - \\bar{y}) \\pm t^* \\cdot SE = 1.5 \\pm 2.032 \\cdot 0.556\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\pm 1.129 \\Rightarrow (0.371, 2.629)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Statistical Significance:**\n\n   Again, since the confidence interval does not include 0, there is a statistically significant difference at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n### Comparison:\n\nBoth methods yield similar confidence intervals, indicating a statistically significant difference between the two filters.

Using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution $\\Phi$, we have:\n   $$ \\pi(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) = 1 - \\Phi\\left( z_{\\alpha} - \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\right) $$\n   $$ \\pi(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) = \\Phi\\left( -z_{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\right) $$\n\nThus, the power function is:\n$$ \\boxed{\\pi(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) = \\Phi\\left( -z_{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\right)} $$\n\n### Part (b): Optimal Sample Sizes for Fixed Total Sample Size\n\n**Approach:**\n\nWe want to maximize the power for a fixed total sample size $N = n_1 + n_2$. The power is maximized by minimizing the variance of the test statistic, which is $\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}$.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. We need to minimize the expression $\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}$ subject to the constraint $n_1 + n_2 = N$.\n\n2. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set up the Lagrangian:\n   $$ \\mathcal{L}(n_1, n_2, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\lambda (n_1 + n_2 - N) $$\n\n3. Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:\n   $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_1} = -\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1^2} + \\lambda = 0 $$\n   $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_2} = -\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2^2} + \\lambda = 0 $$\n   $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = n_1 + n_2 - N = 0 $$\n\n4. From the first two equations, we have:\n   $$ \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2^2} $$\n   $$ \\frac{\\sigma_1}{n_1} = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{n_2} $$\n   $$ \\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_2} $$\n\n5. Using the constraint $n_1 + n_2 = N$, we solve for $n_1$ and $n_2$:\n   $$ n_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N $$\n   $$ n_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N $$\n\nThus, the optimal sample sizes are:\n$$ \\boxed{n_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N} $$\n\n### Part (c): Smallest Total Sample Size for Given Power\n\n**Approach:**\n\nWe need to find the smallest $N$ such that the power is at least $1 - \\beta$ when $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta$.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. The power function for $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta$ is:\n   $$ \\pi(\\delta) = \\Phi\\left( -z_{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\right) $$\n\n2. We want $\\pi(\\delta) \\geq 1 - \\beta$, which implies:\n   $$ \\Phi\\left( -z_{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\right) \\geq 1 - \\beta $$\n\n3. This is equivalent to:\n   $$ -z_{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\geq z_{\\beta} $$\n\n4. Solving for $N$, using the optimal allocation $n_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N$ and $n_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N$, we have:\n   $$ \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N}}} $$\n\n5. Simplifying, we find:\n   $$ \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)^2}{N}}} = \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{N}}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} $$\n\n6. Setting this equal to $z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta}$, we get:\n   $$ \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{N}}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} = z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta} $$\n\n7. Solving for $N$, we have:\n   $$ \\sqrt{N} = \\frac{(z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta})(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)}{\\delta} $$\n   $$ N = \\left( \\frac{(z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta})(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)}{\\delta} \\right)^2 $$\n\nThus, the smallest total sample size is:\n$$ \\boxed{N = \\left( \\frac{(z_{\\alpha} + z_{\\beta})(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2)}{\\delta} \\right)^2} $$\n\n### Part (d): Calculate Sample Sizes for Given Parameters\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\beta = 0.10$, $\\delta = 2.0$, $\\sigma_1 = 2.0$, $\\sigma_2 = 4.0$\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Find $z_{\\alpha}$ and $z_{\\beta}$:\n   - For $\\alpha = 0.05$, $z_{\\alpha} = 1.645$ (since it's a one-sided test).\n   - For $\\beta = 0.10$, $z_{\\beta} = 1.282$.\n\n2. Calculate $N$ using the formula from part (c):\n   $$ N = \\left( \\frac{(1.645 + 1.282)(2.0 + 4.0)}{2.0} \\right)^2 $$\n   $$ N = \\left( \\frac{2.927 \\times 6.0}{2.0} \\right)^2 $$\n   $$ N = \\left( 8.781 \\right)^2 $$\n   $$ N = 77.12 $$\n\n3. Round $N$ up to the nearest integer: $N = 78$.\n\n4. Calculate $n_1$ and $n_2$ using the optimal allocation:\n   $$ n_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N = \\frac{2.0}{6.0} \\times 78 = 26 $$\n   $$ n_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} N = \\frac{4.0}{6.0} \\times 78 = 52 $$\n\nThus, the sample sizes are:\n$$ \\boxed{n_1 = 26, \\quad n_2 = 52} $$\n\nThis completes the solution to the problem, providing a comprehensive derivation and calculation for each part."

Mathematically, this is $p_1 = p_2$, where $p_1$ is the proportion of cold incidence in the Vitamin C group, and $p_2$ is the proportion in the Placebo group.\n  \n- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** There is a difference in the incidence rates of cold between the two groups. Mathematically, this is $p_1 \\neq p_2$.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the Sample Proportions\n\n- Proportion of cold in the Vitamin C group: \n  \\[\n  \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{17}{139} \\approx 0.1223\n  \\]\n\n- Proportion of cold in the Placebo group:\n  \\[\n  \\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{31}{140} \\approx 0.2214\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the Pooled Proportion\n\nThe pooled proportion $\\hat{p}$ is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of cold cases}}{\\text{Total number of participants}} = \\frac{17 + 31}{139 + 140} = \\frac{48}{279} \\approx 0.1720\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the Standard Error\n\nThe standard error (SE) for the difference between two proportions is given by:\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}\n\\]\nwhere $n_1 = 139$ and $n_2 = 140$.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{0.1720 \\times (1 - 0.1720) \\left(\\frac{1}{139} + \\frac{1}{140}\\right)} \\approx \\sqrt{0.1423 \\times 0.0143} \\approx 0.0445\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate the Test Statistic\n\nThe z-test statistic is calculated as:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{SE} = \\frac{0.1223 - 0.2214}{0.0445} \\approx -2.225\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6: Determine the Critical Value and Make a Decision\n\nFor a two-tailed test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical z-values are approximately $\\pm 1.96$.\n\n- If $|z| > 1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis.\n- If $|z| \\leq 1.96$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIn this case, $|z| = 2.225 > 1.96$, so we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nSince we reject the null hypothesis, there is statistically significant evidence at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level to suggest that there is a difference in the incidence rates of cold between the Vitamin C and Placebo groups. This suggests that Vitamin C may have an effect on the incidence of cold among the participants in this study.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{There is a significant difference in cold incidence rates between the groups.}}\n\\]"

We will use linear regression, calculate various statistics, and interpret the results.\n\n### (a) Scatter Plot\n\n**Approach:**\n- Plot the data points with the duration of the last eruption on the x-axis and the time to the next eruption on the y-axis.\n- Visually inspect the plot to determine if the relationship appears linear.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Create a scatter plot using the given data. \n- The x-axis represents the \"Duration of Eruption (LAST)\" and the y-axis represents the \"Time Between Eruptions (NEXT)\".\n- Upon plotting, if the points roughly form a straight line, the relationship can be considered approximately linear.\n\n### (b) Least Squares Regression Line\n\n**Approach:**\n- Use the least squares method to fit a linear regression model: \\( Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon \\), where \\( Y \\) is the time to the next eruption and \\( X \\) is the duration of the last eruption.\n- Calculate the coefficients \\( \\beta_0 \\) (intercept) and \\( \\beta_1 \\) (slope).\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the means: \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\).\n2. Calculate the slope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) using:\n   \\[\n   \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}\n   \\]\n3.

Use the regression equation to predict the time to the next eruption for a last eruption of 3 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{Y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n### (c) Proportion of Variability (R-squared)\n\n**Approach:**\n- Calculate the coefficient of determination \\( R^2 \\) to determine the proportion of variability in the time to the next eruption explained by the duration of the last eruption.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the total sum of squares (SST):\n   \\[\n   SST = \\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2\n   \\]\n2. Calculate the regression sum of squares (SSR):\n   \\[\n   SSR = \\sum (\\hat{Y}_i - \\bar{Y})^2\n   \\]\n3. Calculate \\( R^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   R^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST}\n   \\]\n4.

Calculate the standard error of the prediction:\n   \\[\n   SE_{pred} = \\sqrt{MSE \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(3 - \\bar{X})^2}{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}\\right)}\n   \\]\n2.

Calculate the prediction interval:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{Y} \\pm t^* \\times SE_{pred}\n   \\]\n\n### (f) 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the Mean\n\n**Approach:**\n- Calculate the confidence interval for the mean time to the next eruption when the last eruption lasted 3 minutes.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the standard error of the mean prediction:\n   \\[\n   SE_{mean} = \\sqrt{MSE \\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(3 - \\bar{X})^2}{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2}\\right)}\n   \\]\n2. Calculate the confidence interval:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{Y} \\pm t^* \\times SE_{mean}\n   \\]\n3. Compare this CI with the PI: The CI is narrower than the PI because it estimates the mean rather than a single observation.\n\n### (g) 95% Prediction Interval for 1 Minute\n\n**Approach:**\n- Repeat the prediction interval calculation for a last eruption of 1 minute.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Follow the same steps as in (e) but substitute 1 for 3 in the calculations.\n2. Consider the reliability: If 1 minute is outside the range of observed data, the prediction may be less reliable due to extrapolation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEach part of the problem involves specific statistical calculations and interpretations. The linear regression model provides insights into the relationship between the duration of the last eruption and the time to the next eruption, with the prediction and confidence intervals offering estimates for future observations and means, respectively."

            "solution": "To solve this problem, we will go through each part step-by-step, using statistical methods to analyze the data provided. Let's start with a brief outline of our approach:\n\n1. **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the data to assess linearity.\n2. **Least Squares Regression Line**: Fit a linear model to the data.\n3. **Mean Square Error (MSE)**: Calculate the estimate of the variance of the errors.\n4. **Significance Test**: Test for a significant linear trend.\n5. **Prediction Interval (PI)**: Calculate a 95% PI for 2004 and discuss its reliability.\n\n### (a) Scatter Plot\n\nTo create a scatter plot, plot the years on the x-axis and the distances on the y-axis. This will help us visually assess whether the relationship between year and distance is approximately linear.\n\n**Solution**: \n\nThe scatter plot should show a general upward trend, indicating that as the years progress, the winning distances tend to increase. This suggests a potential linear relationship, but we need to confirm this with a regression analysis.\n\n### (b) Fit a Least Squares Regression Line\n\nTo fit a least squares regression line, we need to calculate the slope ($\\beta_1$) and intercept ($\\beta_0$) of the line using the formulas:\n\n\\[\n\\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x}\n\\]\n\nwhere $x_i$ are the years, $y_i$ are the distances, $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the years, and $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the distances.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Calculate $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$.\n2. Compute $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ using the formulas above.\n3. The regression line is $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n\n### (c) Calculate the Mean Square Error Estimate of $\\sigma$\n\nThe mean square error (MSE) is an estimate of the variance of the errors in the regression model. It is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n-2} \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values from the regression line.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Calculate the predicted values $\\hat{y}_i$ for each year.\n2. Compute the residuals $y_i - \\hat{y}_i$.\n3. Calculate the MSE using the formula above.\n\n### (d) Test for a Significant Increasing Linear Trend\n\nTo test for a significant linear trend, we perform a hypothesis test on the slope $\\beta_1$:\n\n- Null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$ (no linear trend)\n- Alternative hypothesis $H_a: \\beta_1 > 0$ (positive linear trend)\n\nThe test statistic is:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\beta_1}{\\text{SE}(\\beta_1)}\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\text{SE}(\\beta_1)$ is the standard error of the slope, calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SE}(\\beta_1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}\n\\]\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Calculate the test statistic $t$.\n2. Compare $t$ to the critical value from the $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n3. Conclude whether there is a significant trend.\n\n### (e) Calculate a 95% Prediction Interval for 2004\n\nThe prediction interval for a future observation $y_{n+1}$ is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_{n+1} \\pm t^* \\cdot \\sqrt{\\text{MSE} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_{n+1} - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nwhere $t^*$ is the critical value from the $t$-distribution.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Calculate the predicted value $\\hat{y}_{2004}$.\n2. Compute the prediction interval using the formula above.\n3. Discuss the reliability of this prediction and the interpretation of a confidence interval for 2004.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEach part of the problem involves specific statistical techniques. The scatter plot provides a visual check for linearity, the regression line quantifies the relationship, the MSE estimates the error variance, the hypothesis test checks for significance, and the prediction interval provides a range for future observations. The reliability of the prediction depends on the assumption that the linear trend continues beyond the observed data. A confidence interval for 2004 would not be meaningful as it estimates the mean response, not a single observation."

If the points lie approximately on the line, the normality assumption is satisfied.\n\n**Constant Variance:**\n- Plot residuals versus fitted values. If the spread of residuals is consistent across all fitted values, the assumption of homogeneity of variance is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the ANOVA results and assumption checks, conclude whether caffeine dose has a significant effect on finger tapping performance.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n- **Box Plots:** Indicate potential differences, especially for the 200 mg group.\n- **ANOVA Test:** Perform calculations to determine if differences are statistically significant.\n- **Assumptions:** Check normality and constant variance using residual plots."

These tests are nonparametric and rely on the ranks or signs of the data rather than the data values themselves.\n\n### (a) Lowest Attainable P-value for One-sided Sign Test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test\n\n**Approach:**\n- For the one-sided sign test, the test statistic follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (number of trials) and $p = 0.5$ (probability of success).\n- For the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the test statistic is based on the sum of ranks of positive differences, which also has a discrete distribution.\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Sign Test:** The most extreme case occurs when all $n$ signs are positive. The probability of this happening is $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$, as each sign has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being positive.\n- **Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test:** Similarly, the most extreme case is when all ranks are assigned to positive differences. The probability of this happening is also $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$, as each rank can be assigned to a positive or negative difference with equal probability.\n\nThus, the lowest attainable P-value for both tests is $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\n\n### (b) Possibility of Rejecting $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.01$ for $n = 6$\n\n**Solution:**\n- For $n = 6$, the lowest attainable P-value is $(\\frac{1}{2})^6 = \\frac{1}{64} \\approx 0.015625$.\n- Since $0.015625 > 0.01$, it is not possible to reject $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.01$ with $n = 6$.\n\n### (c) Smallest Sample Size for Rejection at $\\alpha = 0.01$\n\n**Solution:**\n- We need $(\\frac{1}{2})^n \\leq 0.01$.\n- Solving for $n$, we have $n \\geq \\log_{2}(100) \\approx 6.644$.\n- Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest $n$ is 7.\n\n### (d) Lowest Attainable P-value for One-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test\n\n**Approach:**\n- The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test statistic is based on the ranks of combined samples from two groups.\n- The most extreme case occurs when all ranks are assigned to one group.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The number of ways to choose $n_1$ ranks from $n_1 + n_2$ total ranks is $\\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1}$.\n- The probability of the most extreme case (all ranks assigned to one group) is $\\frac{1}{\\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1}}$.\n\n### (e) Possibility of Rejecting $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.01$ for $n_1 = n_2 = 4$\n\n**Solution:**\n- For $n_1 = n_2 = 4$, the total number of ways to assign ranks is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\n- The lowest attainable P-value is $\\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.0143$.\n- Since $0.0143 > 0.01$, it is not possible to reject $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.01$ with $n_1 = n_2 = 4$.\n\n### (f) Smallest $n_1 = n_2 = n$ for Rejection at $\\alpha = 0.01$\n\n**Solution:**\n- We need $\\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}} \\leq 0.01$.\n- Solving for $n$, we find the smallest $n$ such that $\\binom{2n}{n} \\geq 100$.\n- Checking values, $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$, so $n = 5$ is sufficient.\n\nThus, the smallest $n_1 = n_2 = n$ required is 5.\n\n**Final Answers:**\n- (a) $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$\n- (b) No\n- (c) $n = 7$\n- (d) $\\frac{1}{\\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1}}$\n- (e) No\n- (f) $n = 5$"

            "solution": "To solve this problem, we will address each part separately, providing detailed steps and reasoning.\n\n### Part (a)\n\n**Objective:** Determine if there is a significant interaction in the two-way ANOVA given the group means and MSE (Mean Square Error).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Understand the Interaction:** In a two-way ANOVA, interaction between two factors means that the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor. We can visually inspect the group means to see if there is a pattern suggesting interaction.\n\n2. **Calculate Interaction Effects:** We will calculate the interaction effects by comparing the differences in means across the levels of the factors.\n\n3. **Use MSE for Significance:** The MSE is used to assess the variability within groups. A small MSE relative to the differences in means suggests significant effects.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Main Effects:**\n   - For Variable 1 (A, B, C), calculate the average across levels of Variable 2 (Low, High).\n   - For Variable 2 (Low, High), calculate the average across levels of Variable 1 (A, B, C).\n\n2. **Calculate the Interaction Effects:**\n   - Interaction effect for each cell is the deviation from what would be expected if there were no interaction, i.e., the difference between the observed mean and the sum of the main effects.\n\n3. **Compare Interaction Effects to MSE:**\n   - If the interaction effects are large compared to the MSE, it suggests a significant interaction.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Main Effects:**\n  - Variable 1 A: Mean = (3.1 + 3.9) / 2 = 3.5\n  - Variable 1 B: Mean = (5.2 + 1.2) / 2 = 3.2\n  - Variable 1 C: Mean = (5.9 + 1.9) / 2 = 3.9\n  - Variable 2 Low: Mean = (3.1 + 5.2 + 5.9) / 3 = 4.733\n  - Variable 2 High: Mean = (3.9 + 1.2 + 1.9) / 3 = 2.333\n\n- **Interaction Effects:**\n  - For (Low, A): 3.1 - (3.5 + 4.733 - 3.5) = 3.1 - 4.733 = -1.633\n  - For (Low, B): 5.2 - (3.2 + 4.733 - 3.2) = 5.2 - 4.733 = 0.467\n  - For (Low, C): 5.9 - (3.9 + 4.733 - 3.9) = 5.9 - 4.733 = 1.167\n  - For (High, A): 3.9 - (3.5 + 2.333 - 3.5) = 3.9 - 2.333 = 1.567\n  - For (High, B): 1.2 - (3.2 + 2.333 - 3.2) = 1.2 - 2.333 = -1.133\n  - For (High, C): 1.9 - (3.9 + 2.333 - 3.9) = 1.9 - 2.333 = -0.433\n\n- **Compare to MSE:**\n  - MSE = 0.2. The interaction effects are relatively large compared to the MSE, suggesting a significant interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is likely a significant interaction effect in the ANOVA analysis because the interaction effects are large compared to the MSE.\n\n### Part (b)\n\n**Objective:** Analyze the two-way ANOVA with empty cells as a one-way ANOVA.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Empty Cells:** Recognize the cells with data and treat them as levels in a one-way ANOVA.\n\n2. **Model the Data:** Use a one-way ANOVA model where each non-empty cell is a level.\n\n3. **Interpret the Parameters:** Relate the parameters of the one-way ANOVA to the original two-way design.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Non-Empty Cells:**\n   - (Low, B), (Low, C), (High, A), (High, B) are non-empty.\n\n2. **One-Way ANOVA Model:**\n   - Let $Y_{ij}$ be the observation in the $i$-th group (cell) and $j$-th observation within that group.\n   - Model: $Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\epsilon_{ij}$, where $\\mu$ is the overall mean, $\\tau_i$ is the effect of the $i$-th group, and $\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\n3. **Interpret Parameters:**\n   - $\\mu$: Overall mean of all observations.\n   - $\\tau_i$: Effect of the $i$-th cell, which combines the effects of both factors.\n   - $\\sigma^2$: Variance within each cell, assumed equal across cells.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy treating each non-empty cell as a level in a one-way ANOVA, we can analyze the data despite the missing cells. The parameters $\\tau_i$ represent the combined effects of the two factors for each observed combination, and $\\sigma^2$ represents the within-cell variance.

Given the assumptions about the variances, we will also need to pool the variances appropriately.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Pooled Variance\n\nGiven the relationships between the variances:\n\\[\n\\sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_B^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_D^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe can express the variances in terms of a common variance $\\sigma^2$:\n\\[\n\\sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_B^2 = \\sigma^2, \\quad \\sigma_C^2 = 2\\sigma^2, \\quad \\sigma_D^2 = 2\\sigma^2\n\\]\n\nThe pooled variance for sites A and B is:\n\\[\ns_{AB}^2 = \\frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B - 2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n_A = 10 \\), \\( n_B = 15 \\), \\( s_A^2 = 8.19 \\), and \\( s_B^2 = 8.51 \\).\n\n\\[\ns_{AB}^2 = \\frac{(10 - 1) \\times 8.19 + (15 - 1) \\times 8.51}{10 + 15 - 2} = \\frac{73.71 + 119.14}{23} = \\frac{192.85}{23} \\approx 8.39\n\\]\n\nThe pooled variance for sites C and D is:\n\\[\ns_{CD}^2 = \\frac{(n_C - 1)s_C^2 + (n_D - 1)s_D^2}{n_C + n_D - 2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n_C = 10 \\), \\( n_D = 15 \\), \\( s_C^2 = 17.05 \\), and \\( s_D^2 = 14.88 \\).\n\n\\[\ns_{CD}^2 = \\frac{(10 - 1) \\times 17.05 + (15 - 1) \\times 14.88}{10 + 15 - 2} = \\frac{153.45 + 208.32}{23} = \\frac{361.77}{23} \\approx 15.73\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Test the First Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\\[\nH_0: 4\\mu_A - 2\\mu_B - 2\\mu_C = 1 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: 4\\mu_A - 2\\mu_B - 2\\mu_C > 1\n\\]\n\n**Test Statistic:**\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{4\\bar{X}_A - 2\\bar{X}_B - 2\\bar{X}_C - 1}{\\sqrt{16\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + 4\\frac{s_B^2}{n_B} + 4\\frac{s_C^2}{n_C}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the sample means and variances:\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{4 \\times 40.22 - 2 \\times 41.68 - 2 \\times 35.91 - 1}{\\sqrt{16 \\times \\frac{8.19}{10} + 4 \\times \\frac{8.51}{15} + 4 \\times \\frac{17.05}{10}}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\\[\n4 \\times 40.22 = 160.88, \\quad 2 \\times 41.68 = 83.36, \\quad 2 \\times 35.91 = 71.82\n\\]\n\\[\n160.88 - 83.36 - 71.82 - 1 = 4.7\n\\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16 \\times 0.819 + 4 \\times 0.567 + 4 \\times 1.705} = \\sqrt{13.104 + 2.268 + 6.82} = \\sqrt{22.192} \\approx 4.71\n\\]\n\nThus, the test statistic is:\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{4.7}{4.71} \\approx 0.9979\n\\]\n\n**Critical Value:**\nFor a one-tailed test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, with degrees of freedom approximated by the smallest sample size minus one (9), the critical value from the t-distribution is approximately 1.833.\n\nSince \\( T_1 = 0.9979 < 1.833 \\), we fail to reject \\( H_0 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Test the Second Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu_A + \\mu_B - 2\\mu_D = 2 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\mu_A + \\mu_B - 2\\mu_D \\neq 2\n\\]\n\n**Test Statistic:**\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{\\bar{X}_A + \\bar{X}_B - 2\\bar{X}_D - 2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \\frac{s_B^2}{n_B} + 4\\frac{s_D^2}{n_D}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the sample means and variances:\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{40.22 + 41.68 - 2 \\times 36.11 - 2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{8.19}{10} + \\frac{8.51}{15} + 4 \\times \\frac{14.88}{15}}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\\[\n40.22 + 41.68 = 81.9, \\quad 2 \\times 36.11 = 72.22\n\\]\n\\[\n81.9 - 72.22 - 2 = 7.68\n\\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{0.819 + 0.567 + 3.952} = \\sqrt{5.338} \\approx 2.31\n\\]\n\nThus, the test statistic is:\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{7.68}{2.31} \\approx 3.325\n\\]\n\n**Critical Value:**\nFor a two-tailed test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, with degrees of freedom approximated by the smallest sample size minus one (9), the critical value from the t-distribution is approximately 2.262.\n\nSince \\( |T_2| = 3.325 > 2.262 \\), we reject \\( H_0 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- For the first hypothesis \\( H_0: 4\\mu_A - 2\\mu_B - 2\\mu_C = 1 \\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n- For the second hypothesis \\( H_0: \\mu_A + \\mu_B - 2\\mu_D = 2 \\), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Fail to reject } H_0 \\text{ for the first hypothesis; reject } H_0 \\text{ for the second hypothesis.}}\n\\]"
