Below is the data collected. \\[ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Site} & \\text{Sample Size} & \\text{Data} & \\text{Sample Mean} & \\text{Sample Variance} \\\\ \\hline A & 10 & 38.3, 39.3, 44.7, 40.2, 40.4, 45.1, 41.4, 36.2, 37.9, 38.7 & 40.22 & 8.19 \\\\ B & 15 & 45.7, 43.1, 43.2, 42.3, 40.3, 47.4, 43.5, 36.1, 44.1, 40.6, 38.8, 41.3, 38.9, 39.8, 40.1 & 41.68 & 8.51 \\\\ C & 10 & 27.8, 38.6, 35.7, 30.2, 40.3, 36.8, 33.7, 38.8, 38.7, 38.5 & 35.91 & 17.05 \\\\ D & 15 & 38.9, 38.4, 35.7, 34.7, 34.4, 33.1, 35.1, 30.6, 45.2, 41.1, 31.2, 34.3, 34.9, 33.9, 35.6 & 36.11 & 14.88 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Let $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$, and $D_i$ denote random samples from site A, B, C, and D, respectively. Based on historical data, it can be assumed that $A_i \\sim N(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$, $B_i \\sim N(\\mu_B, \\sigma_B^2)$, $C_i \\sim N(\\mu_C, \\sigma_C^2)$, and $D_i \\sim N(\\mu_D, \\sigma_D^2)$, where $\\sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_B^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_D^2}{2}$, but the actual values of $\\mu_i$'s and $\\sigma_i^2$ are unknown. A research group is interested in testing the following hypotheses simultaneously at overall $\\alpha = 0.05$: \\[ H_0: 4\\mu_A - 2\\mu_B - 2\\mu_C = 1 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: 4\\mu_A - 2\\mu_B - 2\\mu_C > 1 \\] and \\[ H_0: \\mu_A + \\mu_B - 2\\mu_D = 2 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\mu_A + \\mu_B - 2\\mu_D \\neq 2 \\] What is the conclusion of the hypotheses tests?
